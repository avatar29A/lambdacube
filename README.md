Implementation Lambda Calculus with other Type system: from untyped lambda up to lambda with dependency typed.

It's research project which aims to study various types systems.

## Goals:

Implement follow type system:

- pure lambda (without types)
- simple typed lambda calculus
- STLC with Dependency Types
- Linear types

## Based on

- Lambda Calculus
